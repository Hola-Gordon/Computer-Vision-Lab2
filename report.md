# Texture Classification Analysis Report

## 1. Introduction

This report analyzes the performance of two texture classification algorithms: Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and Local Binary Patterns (LBP). The models were trained to distinguish between three texture classes: stone, brick, and wood. This analysis examines the performance metrics, discusses key findings, and explores factors that influenced classification accuracy.

## 2. Model Performance Overview

### 2.1 Overall Performance Metrics

| Metric | GLCM Model | LBP Model |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| Accuracy | 90.00% | 78.00% |
| Precision | 90.91% | 78.99% |
| Recall | 90.00% | 78.00% |

The GLCM-based classifier significantly outperformed the LBP-based classifier across all metrics, showing a 12% higher overall accuracy.

### 2.2 Per-class Performance

| Class | GLCM Accuracy | LBP Accuracy |
|-------|---------------|--------------|
| Stone | 94.12% | 94.12% |
| Brick | 94.12% | 76.47% |
| Wood  | 81.25% | 62.50% |

## 3. Performance Analysis

### 3.1 Data Quality Impact

The initial dataset contained images with various disturbances such as shadows, inconsistent lighting, and background elements. This significantly affected classification accuracy for both models. After refining the dataset to use more consistent images (e.g., pure brick walls with minimal disturbance), accuracy improved substantially.

**Key Finding**: Image quality and consistency are critical factors in texture classification. Controlled images yield much higher accuracy than uncontrolled ones.

### 3.2 Algorithm Comparison

#### GLCM Performance Strengths
The GLCM-based classifier demonstrated superior performance, particularly for brick and wood textures. GLCM excels at capturing:

1. **Spatial relationships** between pixels
2. **Statistical properties** like contrast, homogeneity, and correlation
3. **Structural patterns** in regular textures with distinctive arrangements

The GLCM approach maintained consistent performance across classes, with only wood showing slightly lower accuracy (81.25%).

#### LBP Performance Limitations
The LBP-based classifier showed comparable performance to GLCM only for stone textures (94.12%). Its performance degraded significantly for brick (76.47%) and wood (62.50%) textures.

This performance gap can be attributed to:

1. **Sensitivity to lighting variations**: LBP relies on relative brightness patterns which can be disrupted by uneven lighting
2. **Scale limitations**: The fixed radius parameter may not capture the varying scale of brick patterns
3. **Texture complexity**: Wood grain patterns with subtle variations are more difficult for LBP to characterize consistently

## 4. Confusion Matrix Analysis

### 4.1 GLCM Confusion Matrix

```
        stone  brick  wood
stone    16     1      0
brick     0    16      1
wood      0     3     13
```

The GLCM confusion matrix reveals:
- Stone classification is highly accurate with only 1 misclassification as brick
- Brick classification is similarly accurate with only 1 misclassification as wood
- Wood shows the most confusion, with 3 samples misclassified as brick

This suggests that the GLCM features can distinguish stone very effectively, while wood and brick share some textural similarities that occasionally cause confusion.

### 4.2 LBP Confusion Matrix

```
        stone  brick  wood
stone    16     1      0
brick     2    13      2
wood      0     6     10
```

The LBP confusion matrix shows:
- Stone classification remains highly accurate (matching GLCM performance)
- Brick samples are frequently misclassified, with 2 as stone and 2 as wood
- Wood samples show significant confusion with brick (6 misclassifications)

This indicates that LBP struggles to capture the distinctive features of brick and wood textures, particularly when these textures have irregular patterns or varying scales.

## 5. Key Insights

1. **Data quality matters**: Controlled, consistent images significantly improve classification accuracy.

2. **Algorithm selection is context-dependent**:
   - GLCM performs better for structured textures with spatial relationships
   - LBP performs adequately for textures with consistent local patterns (like stone)
   - The choice between GLCM and LBP should consider the specific texture characteristics

3. **Class imbalance impact**: Both classifiers performed better on stone and brick than on wood, suggesting potential room for improvement in wood texture representation.

4. **Misclassification patterns**: The confusion primarily occurs between brick and wood classes, indicating these textures share features that can be difficult to distinguish.

## 6. Conclusion

The GLCM-based classifier demonstrates superior performance for texture classification tasks, particularly for distinguishing between stone, brick, and wood. Its ability to capture spatial relationships and statistical properties makes it more robust to variations in texture patterns.

The study highlights the importance of data quality and preprocessing in texture classification. Controlled, consistent images with minimal disturbance significantly improve classification accuracy.

Future work could focus on:
1. Implementing hybrid approaches that combine GLCM and LBP features
2. Exploring adaptive parameter selection for LBP to better handle varying texture scales
3. Improving wood texture classification through targeted feature engineering
